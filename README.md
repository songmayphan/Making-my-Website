Day 27: Completely renewing the out look of the websites
Log:  I was going to make 3 pages home, about and contact but was stuck for a while. I have remodeled every thing
from the look to the content of the page. I was just thinking about how I don't have any projects or accomplishmenet yet to 
showcase, hence I was discoraged by the idea of having a trophy case without any trophy.. But then I thought, it would be great to have
a website that gives people a little peek about who I am, what I do and what I aspire for. So I proceeded. Also, by doing this
I have a great motivation to learn HTML and CSS, and in the future, Javascript. I know I have broken the #100daysofCode rules by not working on this everyday. I just wish we have more than 24 hours in a day to do what we neeed to.. But I will continue and will not stop until my goal is reached! Looking forward to the 100th days!!
