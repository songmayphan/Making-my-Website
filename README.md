# Making-my-Website
A display of my self-learning process of HTML and CSS in order to make my own website as a personal portfolio. This website will showcase every projects I will be making and all my personal side projects.

This website is also the project of my #100DaysofCode journey! I will be logging in everything I learnt from day 0 to day 100. My goal is to code and learn everyday for at least an hour. The progress of my website will be the proof of my commitment to the challenge.
