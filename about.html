		  <p> I'm currently a second year student at Rollins College and an undergraduate in Computer Science. Having been a foreign student in the United States of America for almost three years, I have learnt alot not only the cultural differences but also the advances of technology of the USA compare to Vietnam, where I come from, and the rest of the world.

		<h2> What I aspire for </h2> 
	  <p> My passion for technology has grown significantly since I learn about the potential of machine learning and artificial intelligent. I would love to utilize what I learn from college to apply for the upcoming projects. My goal for machine learning would be to contribute to the advances of anything applicable, from travelling to banking. </p> 
		<p> Ever since I was a kid, I have always wanted to make something useful, something that would help anyone, to do anything. The path that I chose now, is simply perfect. </p>
		<p> The more I learn about technology, the more inspired I become. The advances of technology is undeniably fast. That is why I know the path I chose will never stop me from learning new things everyday I wake up. That, the chance and the ability to learn, is the most precious gift life has granted us.  </p>
