      <p> I'm currently a second year student at Rollins College and an undergraduate in Computer Science. Having been a foreign student in the United States of America for almost three years, I have learnt alot not only the cultural differences but also the advances of technology of the USA compare to Vietnam, where I come from, and the rest of the world. 

	  <p> My passion for technology has grown significantly since I learn about the potential of machine learning and artificial intelligent. I would love to utilize what I learn from college to apply for the upcoming projects. My goal for machine learning would be to contribute to the advances of anything applicable, from travelling to banking. </p>     </div>
