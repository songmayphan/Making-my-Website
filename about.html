		I'm currently a second year student at Rollins College and a candidates for Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science. 
	Having been a foreign student in the United States of America for almost three years, I have learnt alot not only
	the cultural differences but also the advances of technology of the USA compare to Vietnam, where I come from, and
	the rest of the world.

		My passion for technology has grown significantly since I learn about the potential of machine learning and artificial
	intelligent. I would love to utilize what I learn from college to apply for the upcoming projects. My goal for machine 
	learning would be to contribute to the advances of anything applicable, from travelling to banking.
